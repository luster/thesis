## Denoising concert recordings

Objective: remove noise from single-channel recordings of concerts without access to an original recording. Weak labels come in the form of segments of audio labeled as "noise only" or "noise and signal."

## Currently working on

- Save models/plots/recordings more often
- Code to import model parameters from .npz files
- Characterize distortion using a trained model on sine waves/chirps
- Save specgram, time domain, and latent var plots
- Organized folder structure based on parameters/date
- Early stopping
- Try a deeper network (more conv layers, maybe fully connected layers at the output)
- Output the network in the time domain, modify loss function to do MSE on the time domain signal
